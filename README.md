# Introduction 
Being the third son in my family, I wanted to answer some childhood questions using data science and econometrics.

1. To what extent does having two kids of the same sex impact a couples probability to have more than two kids? 
2. How does having more kids affect a mother's likelihood to return to work?
3. How does having a larger number of children impact family earnings?

# Notion Page
There is a dedicated Notion page that narrates the background knowledge, work flow, and results to a much greater extent.

# Data
Found in the 'data' folder, our data comes from the 2010 Census and it contains information about 236,459 married couples*. Each row represents one member of a couple. All couples have:

* at least 2 children
* a traditional mother and father
* an age between 21 and 35
* a father that worked in the past year

Thank you to David Card and his class Econometrics C142 for providing sample.csv file. 

# Models
The modeling work and intermediate results can be found in the 'notebooks' folder where there are 4 Python notebooks

# Further Work
This folder contains a notebook that builds on findings in the original project scope by looking at earnings by state.
